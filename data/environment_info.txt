WET-BULB:
Based on: Singapore 486980 (IWEC) [EPW-file] - EnergyPlus version of the respective International Weather for Energy Calculations (IWEC) weather file from ASHRAE
Retrieved from (on 10. November 2019): https://energyplus.net/weather-location/southwest_pacific_wmo_region_5/SGP//SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC
Calculation: Wet bulb is theoretically derived with the Python package CoolProp from the data of IWEC.
Quadratic interpolation: weather data is only provided per hour, but prices per half hour. Therefore each half-hour wet-bulb is obtained through quadratic interpolation (with Python package Pandas).
For the first half hour to be determinable this way a 00:00 time instance had to be added. It corresponds to the last instance of the weather data, meaning t_0 = t_17520.

POWER PRICE:
Type: Wholesale Electricity Prices 2018
